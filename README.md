# Psychedelic-Art-Generator

This project is still currently in development; however, it currently contains some basic functionality that may be useful in similar applications. Feel free to use the Color Wheel, Shape Resizing Tool or any other part of this project in your own app! The purpose of this project is to create an interface similar to that of Microsoft Paint, Photoshop, or any graphic design software for a mobile device. The Psychedelic Art Generator app has been created to be supported on both iPhone and iPad. 
Currently, I have implemented two custom UI components in swift that could be useful in mobile apps with the purpose of allowing users to select colors, or resize images. See Color Wheel and Double Slider for more information!
Another major feature of this project is to give developers the ability to develop mobile games on their own mobile devices. Although not currently implemented, this application will eventually have the ability to include animation, and code generation to be exported to the computer. The idea is that you draw the graphics on the Art Canvas, press "Generate Code", and the app will either email or AirDrop a txt file containing all of the code needed to generate the graphics you drew!
